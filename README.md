Inventory Shrinkage Analysis & Prediction

This project analyzes retail inventory shrinkage by combining datasets on stock, sales, and returns to identify product loss patterns. Using data cleaning, aggregation, and exploratory analysis, it builds predictive models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to forecast shrinkage. The project includes interactive visualizations and a dashboard to help businesses monitor inventory loss, improve operational efficiency, and reduce financial impact.
